# optimize
This challenge introduces optimization of a programm to the player.

**Description of the Challenge:**
We hired a student to calculate this flag. He did it successfully, but it's kinda slow.
So now we hired you to get the flag (without payment of cource ;)

## Setup
--

## Solution
The programm add all primes till sum exceeds 1.000.000.000. Possible solutions are: remove unnecessary loops etc. or use the sieve of eratosthenes.

## Flag
THICTF{1000017876}
