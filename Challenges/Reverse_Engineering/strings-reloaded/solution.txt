The flag is created during the program execution.
Some of the char pointers are used.
The output is a sha1 hash and the player need to reverse the binary in order to get the correct flag.

The variables 'string4, string61, and string123 are used to build the flag.
char* string4 = "UpoUnCvI";
char* string61 = "Udglkwhx";
char* string123 = "XuelCDQy";

Only the binary is provied. The C Code will not be provied.

Flag: THICTF{UpoUnCvIUdglkwhxXuelCDQy}

----------

Description:
Aaaah, again a lot of strings. The flag format is THICTF{<clear-text>} where <clear-text> is the decrypted string of the displayed hash.
Find the correct flag in the binary!

Hint: You will not be able to brute force the hash.
