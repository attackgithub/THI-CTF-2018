You got the random.jpg and the create_xxx.py files.
The random numbers created throught the python script aren't so random. 
Just swap the "+" to "-" in the calculation and you got the flag. 

Flag: THICTF{rand0m_is_n0t_s0_rand0m}

Description:
It seems that the image <Link> shown the flag, but its randomized. 
Is there any way to get back the original flag?
Maybe this script <Link> helps you!
