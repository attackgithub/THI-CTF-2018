# The_Only_One
This challenge introduces an *off-by-one* vulnerability to the player.

**Description of the Challenge:**
Java is smarter than C, because there is thrown an exception for everything, for instance: Boundaries!

## Setup
The following command was used to create the binary file:
```gcc binary_32.c -z execstack -z norelro -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -ggdb -m32 -o binary_32```

## Solution
Execute the binary. Next, you have to add a 9th team member with the right name.
The goal is 400 so the 9th name need to be `dddd`.

## Flag
THICTF{My_F1rst_0ff_By_0ne_Expl0it}
