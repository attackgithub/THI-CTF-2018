The flag is in the binary file. 
Use "strings" or something else to get all strings out of the binary file.


Flag: THICTF{too_easy_0815}

Examples:
strings binary | grep CTF
hexdump -C binary

Description:
Some guy handed me this (<Link>). 
But it's to heavy to guess the number? 
Hmm or maybe I have to do something else. 
Can you help me?
