This challenges introduces the UNIX command `strings` to the player.
**Description of the Challenge:**
Some guy handed me this (<Link>). But it's to heavy to guess the number? Hmm or maybe I have to do something else. Can you help me?

## Setup
* Flag is in clear-text representation in the binary file
* The following command is used to generate the binary without protection mechanisms:
```gcc binary.c -z execstack -z norelro -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -ggdb -o binary```

## Solution
Run `strings` or `hexdump` on the binary file.
```strings binary | grep CTF```
```hexdump -C binary```

## Flag
Flag: THICTF{too_easy_0815}
