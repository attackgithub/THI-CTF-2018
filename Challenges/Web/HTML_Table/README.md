# HTML_Table
Introduction to HTML Tables.

**Description of the Challenge:**
You've found a suspicious looking HTML-Table with various CSS-classes.
Maybe if we change some CSS-attributes a hidden message will be visible?

Hint: Put the flag between the brackets of 'THICTF{}'

## Setup
--

## Solution
```
.debug{
	background: black;
}
```

Sets color of real flag-blocks to black, so *EASYFLAG* becomes visible.

## Flag
THICTF{EASYFLAG}
