Description of the functions:
-----------------------------

function randomText():
Nothing will happen in the function randomText() because the string a is surrounded by "".
Therefore, the string is always the same.
If you make a.split (""), the string is mixed.

function shuffleText():
This function reflects the Caesar cipher.
