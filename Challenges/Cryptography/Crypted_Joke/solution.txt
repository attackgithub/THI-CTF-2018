The flag is in the image, but the text is encrypted. 
You have to extract the text with an ocr (like tesseract or with MS OneNote) and then decrypt it.

Flag: THICTF{BECAUSE_THEY_HAD_EGGS}

Cipher: Vigenere
Key: eggs (Image name)


Example:
tesseract eggs.jpg stdout|file.txt
copy the text into an online tool

Description:
Hey man, I can't read the text in the image <Link>. 
Maybe I need a key or something else? 
Can you help?
