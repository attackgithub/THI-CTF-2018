Hey you! Did you see that message that looks like an electronic codebook? I can't decrypt it because the key is not complete. I only know that the three question marks have something to do with one of those names:

- Thesaurus
- Schneier
- Security
- Reykjavik
- Safety
- Rjindael
- Feistel
- Ratchet


 
Key: 16-BYTE-???-KEY!
