# Quizzing
This challenge contains different security related questions.

**Description of the Challenge:**
The flag will be composed of the small letters (in order) representing the answers. The format is *THICTF{(the letters)}*. If, for example, the answers to questions 1. to 6. would be a) and the last answer would be d), the flag would be: *THICTF{aaaaaad}*. Attention, you only get three flag-submit attempts, so trying out many combinations will be your doom. 

## Setup

## Flag
