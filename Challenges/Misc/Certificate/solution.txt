This certificate has an extension by the name "Capture Identifier" which is made up.

It holds the base64 encoded flag, with a ":" every two letters.

So 
VE:hJ:Q1:RG:e2:V4:dG:Vu:c2:lv:bn:Nf:YX:Jl:X2:Z1:bn:0=
becomes 
VEhJQ1RGe2V4dGVuc2lvbnNfYXJlX2Z1bn0==
which can be fed to something like base64decode.org to get the flag

note: Decoders might ignore the ":"'s already, so deleting them is not always necessary

Text:
Something seems to be wrong with this certificate...
