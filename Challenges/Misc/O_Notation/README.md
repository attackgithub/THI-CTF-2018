# O_Notation
This challenge introduces the complexity of functions to the player.

**Description of the Challenge:**
Complexity of a function?

## Setup
Create functions with different complexity.

## Solution
The attached jave-file (`Main.java`) contains eight functions. You have to sort these functions according to the O-notation. After correctly sorting, you get the flag by concatenating the return-statements.
The correct order of the functions is: (sqr = squareroot, n^x = n to the power of x) 
```
fun1, O(1)
fun3, O(log²n)
fun8, O(n)
fun2, O(n*log n)
fun6, O(n sqr n)
fun5, O(n²)
fun4, O(n^4)
fun7, O(n^9)
```
