The "image_org.jpg" is reversed byte by byte.
You have to create a script or a program to solve this challenge (like "byteswap").
After swapping, the flag shows up in the image.

Flag: THICTF{F0REN5IC5_F0R_W1N}


Description:
Hmm, it looks like a jpg, but I can't read it! Maybe I swap the image viewer. What do you think?
