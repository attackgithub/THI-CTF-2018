# Swap
This challenge introduces some programming techniques to the player.

**Description of the Challenge:**
Hmm, it looks like a jpg, but I can't read it! Maybe I swap the image viewer. What do you think?

## Setup

## Solution
The "image_org.jpg" is reversed byte by byte. You have to create a script or a program to solve this challenge (like `byteswap.c`). After swapping, the flag shows up in the image.
