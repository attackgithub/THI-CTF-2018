PDF with hidden (embedded) attachment (JPG).
The flag is in the Image (THICTF{FUN_W1TH_PDFs}).

Created with:    "pdftk <PDF filename> attach_files <attachment filename> output <output filename>"
Then I have changed the "PDF Reference Table" so, that the attachment shows up, but you can't extract it.

Solution:
Read the file binary with "vi" or something else and search for "xref".
Change the fourth entry from "f" to "n".
Extraction with: "pdftk <PDF filename> unpack_files [output <output folder>]" --> or a similar tool!

Solution (Kevin):
No need to change the xref entry. Use something like binwalk to extract the content.

My friend gave me this <Link>. Maybe there is something hidden, figure it out!
